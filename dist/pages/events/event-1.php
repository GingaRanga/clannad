      <hr>
      <h5 class="text-dark">Workshop focus</h5>
      <p>Using a trauma-informed attachment based perspective, Joanne and Michelle will help participants conceptualize their clients, weave in their observations and, most importantly, formulate an intervention model.  Using Circle of Security as a basis for this understanding and then applying it to not just children but clients of all ages, we can move the attachment lens to understand motivations behind behaviours and how to work to become effective treatment providers.</p>
      <h5 class="text-dark">Who should attend</h5>
      <p>Social workers, psychologists, child protection workers, child and youth care workers, teachers, early childhood educators, early interventionists, and others who work with children and families</p>
      <p>Please let us know if you have a particular learning need and we will do our best to accommodate.</p>
      <strong class="text-dark">Sign up early to ensure you have one of the 70 seats!</strong>
