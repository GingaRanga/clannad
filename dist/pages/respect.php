      <h2>What is Respect?</h2>
      <p class="lead">Respect means accepting and not discriminating against the gender, sexual orientation, cultural, linguistic, racial, different abilities or religious backgrounds of the people in our programs. Respect means people in our programs can develop and realize their own goals based on their strengths and abilities. We work to create an environment of mutual respect so our clients feel safe to focus on the issues that brought them into therapy.</p>
