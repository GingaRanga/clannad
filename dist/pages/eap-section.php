						<h3>What is EAP?</h3>
						<p>Offering an alternative approach to other traditional forms of talk therapy, Equine Assisted Psychotherapy (EAP) involves the use of horses in the therapeutic session.</p>
						<h3>The Horses</h3>
						<p>As natural herd animals, horses offer a sense of security for each other, help each other face challenges and provide comfort to one another - leading to overall emotional well-being. The semi-structured exercises used in EAP allow the participants to benefit from the natural instincts of horses. The experience with the animals provides immediate feedback to participants, leading to deeper self-awareness, discovery of buried emotions, and can enrich the therapeutic process. As humans, we are social animals who need others in order to feel whole - and even to survive. It is through this connection in our relationships that we develop, understand and heal.</p>

			<hr>
			<p class="lead text-light mb-5">During an EAP session, you will see clinical staff and a horse handler who have all been trained in EAP and Equine Assisted Learning (EAL).</p>

					<h3 class="text-dark">How it Works</h3>
					<p>EAP encourages our learning and understanding, helps us to recognize the patterns that exist in our relationships, and allows us to grow our emotional connectedness and relationships with each other. By moving through a set of semi-structured exercises, participants will be a part of a journey of self-discovery and awareness, creating the opportunity for personal growth and healing ruptures in relationships.</p>
					<h3 class="text-dark">Who Can Utilize EAP?</h3>
					<p>There is no prior horse experience required to participate in EAP, Rohan Wood Stables is completely accessible and the activities that individuals and families participate in can be responsive to any physical exceptionalities required.</p>
