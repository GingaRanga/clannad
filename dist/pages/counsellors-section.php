              <p>Connecting through relationship and supporting individuals in their own healing journey has always been a passion of mine.

                <p>of relationships, I have been drawn to attachment based therapy that offers me a framework that matches my interest in human connection and how our relationships influence our development in childhood and throughout our lives.</p>
                <p>My experience over the last 12 years includes working with military families, children, youth, veterans, and couples. I utilize a variety of therapeutic modalities including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Emotion Focused Therapy for individuals and couples, Circle of Security Parenting, and Equine Assisted Psychotherapy involving horses in conjunction with mental health treatment. I have supported people experiencing challenges with anxiety, depression, trauma, addiction, relationship breakdown, child and youth behaviour, post-partum psychosis, and disabilities.</p>
                <p>In my private practice at Clannad, I hope to continue to inspire healing through healthy connection and supportive relationships.</p>

              <p>I began my practice in 2000 with at-risk parents and children, not knowing the impact this work would have in shaping me. Driven by a desire to connect with people in need, I have been blessed to learn from the stories of many who overcome extraordinary challenges.
